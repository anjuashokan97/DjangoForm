# DjangoForm
Form with django

Django maps the fields defined in Django forms into HTML input fields. Django handles three distinct parts of the work involved in forms:

preparing and restructuring data to make it ready for rendering
creating HTML forms for the data
receiving and processing submitted forms and data from the client
